Create a Track JSON object that matches the provided Track schema exactly.

IMPORTANT:
- Return ONLY valid JSON.
- Do NOT include explanations, markdown, or extra text.
- Do NOT include any keys not defined in the Track schema.

────────────────────────
CHOREOGRAPHY MODEL (HARD RULES)
────────────────────────

- Choreography is a sequence of point-in-time CHANGE cues.
- Each choreography item represents a change in exercise, resistance, or pace.
- Do NOT describe durations or narration.
- Do NOT include prep or setup items.

Each choreography item MUST use ONLY these fields:
- timestamp (string, M:SS)
- exercise (string, MUST include icon)
- resistance (string, icon-style instruction)
- gear (number, suggested resulting gear)
- rpmMin (number)
- rpmMax (number)
- note (string, optional, max one sentence)

────────────────────────
EXERCISE + ICON MAPPING (MANDATORY)
────────────────────────

Use the following mapping EXACTLY.
Always include the icon in the exercise field using the format:
"Exercise - Icon"

- Flat / Ride Easy → "Flat - 🚴"
- Climb → "Climb - ⛰️"
- Sprint → "Sprint - ⚡"
- Recovery → "Recovery - 🌀"
- Interval / Surge → "Interval - 🔁"

Rules:
- Do NOT invent new icons.
- Do NOT omit icons.
- If unsure, default to "Flat - 🚴".

────────────────────────
RESISTANCE MODEL (MANDATORY)
────────────────────────

Resistance is based on a Base Gear set at the start of the track or block.

Use icon-style resistance instructions ONLY:
- ↑  = small increase (+1)
- ↑↑ = large increase (+2)
- ↓  = small decrease (−1)
- ↓↓ = large decrease (−2)
- •  = hold resistance
- Lx = set absolute gear

Rules:
- Store the icon instruction in choreography.resistance.
- Store the resulting suggested gear as a number in choreography.gear.
- Always compute the resulting gear correctly.
- Do NOT use resistance ranges.

Examples:
- "↑" with gear 6
- "↑↑" with gear 7
- "•" with gear 7

────────────────────────
PACE / RPM RULES
────────────────────────

- Pace MUST be expressed using rpmMin and rpmMax.
- RPM ranges must align with musical feel.
- No standing above 110 RPM.
- Prioritize safe, rideable cadences.

────────────────────────
TIMING RULES
────────────────────────

- All timestamps MUST:
  - Match one of the allowed block starts provided
  - Land on a musical downbeat
  - Be within the track duration

────────────────────────
STYLE & PRIORITIES
────────────────────────

- Output should read like a professional RPM choreography sheet.
- Keep instructions concise and instructor-readable.
- Prioritize:
  Safety → Musical alignment → Readability → Detail

────────────────────────
